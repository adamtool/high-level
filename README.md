High-level Petri games
======================
A framework for the synthesis of distributed systems modeled with high-level Petri games. 

Contains:
---------
- data structures for symmetric Petri games,
- data structures for the corresponding two-player games over a finite graph (cp. [Acta'20](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00236-020-00368-5)):
  1) explicit version, 
  2) low-level version (exploiting the symmetries of the net),
  3) high-level version (exploiting the symmetries of the net),
  4) bdd version (partially exploiting the symmetries of the net),
- solving algorithms for all the approaches,
- converter to generate a low-level Petri game from a high-level one,
- generators for example high-level Petri games (cp. [ArXiv'19](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05621)).

Integration:
------------
This modules can be used as separate library and
- is integrated in: [adam](https://github.com/adamtool/adam), [adamsynt](https://github.com/adamtool/adamsynt),
- contains the packages: highLevel,
- depends on the repos: [libs](https://github.com/adamtool/libs), [framework](https://github.com/adamtool/framework), [synthesizer](https://github.com/adamtool/synthesizer).

How To Build
------------
A __Makefile__ is located in the main folder.
First, pull a local copy of the dependencies with
```
make pull_dependencies
```
then build the whole framework with all the dependencies with
```
make
```
To build a single dependencies separately, use, e.g,
```
make tools
```
To delete the build files and clean-up
```
make clean
```
To also delete the files generated by the test and all temporary files use
```
make clean-all
```
Some of the algorithms depend on external libraries or tools. To locate them properly create a file in the main folder
```
touch ADAM.properties
```
and add the absolute paths of the necessary libraries or tools:
```
libraryFolder=<path2Repo>/dependencies/libs/
dot=dot
time=/usr/bin/time
buddy=
cudd=
cal=
```
You may leave some of the properties open if you don't use the corresponding libraries/tools.

Tests
-----
To run all tests for the module, just type
```
ant test
```
For testing a specific class use for example
```
ant test-class -Dclass.name=uniolunisaar.adam.tests.hl.TestGGvsSGG
```
and for testing a specific method use for example
```
ant test-method -Dclass.name=uniolunisaar.adam.tests.hl.CompareApproaches -Dmethod.name=testDW
```
